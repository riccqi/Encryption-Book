# A Commitment to Privacy

### This is where the Apple Secure Enclave hardware, built into most modern day Apple devices, comes in. It is a special hardware based key-manager that will request for user authentication before allowing access to the private key.
 
### Let's walk through the code for how we can implement Secure Enclave together with CryptoKit.
