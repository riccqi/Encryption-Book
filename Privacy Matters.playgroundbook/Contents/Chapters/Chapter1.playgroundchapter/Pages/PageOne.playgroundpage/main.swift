# Privacy Matters

## Privacy is a basic human right. Yet privacy breaches are becoming a growing concern because of our increasingly online lives.
## Encryption ensures our data is protected from hackers who wants to use our data without our permission.
 
- Note: Encryption was important even thousands of years ago; Julius Caesar famously used simple ciphers to protect secret messages from his opponents in war.
*/

/*:
## We communicate a lot through online messaging. Popular chat messengers like iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal all use end to end encryption. What does this mean and how does it actually work to protect our privacy?
 
### This Playground will be covering:
 - Basic Encryption and Decryption
 - Using CryptoKit
 - End-to-End Encryption
 - One more thing

- Important: Tap on "Run My Code" now.
