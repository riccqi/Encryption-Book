# Encryption-Book
This is my winning Swift Playground Book submission for the ï£¿ WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge.
 
Users should be empowered to have more knowledge and control of their online privacy. This is a macOS playground book that aims to teach the user about
basic cryptography concepts, and applying that to modern day end-to-end encryption. To make this very theoretical concept more engaging, the entire playground is
themed after a text messenger, with a simple SpriteKit game to show how easily our data can be breached without secure encryption.
 
This playground was made for macOS Swift Playground 3.4.1. 
Thank you for checking out my submission!
